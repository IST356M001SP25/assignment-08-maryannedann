## Instructions

Reflection is a key activity of learning. It helps you build a strong metacognition, or "understanding of your own learning." A good learner not only "knows what they know", but they "know what they don't know", too. Learning to reflect takes practice, but if your goal is to become a self-directed learner where you can teach yourself things, reflection is imperative.

- Now that you've completed the assignment, share your throughts. What did you learn? What confuses you? Where did you struggle? Where might you need more practice?
- A good reflection is: **specific as possible**,  **uses the terminology of the problem domain** (what was learned in class / through readings), and **is actionable** (you can pursue next steps, or be aided in the pursuit). That last part is what will make you a self-directed learner.
- Flex your recall muscles. You might have to review class notes / assigned readings to write your reflection and get the terminology correct.
- Your reflection is for **you**. Yes I make you write them and I read them, but you are merely practicing to become a better self-directed learner. If you read your reflection 1 week later, does what you wrote advance your learning?

Examples:

**Poor Reflection:**  "I don't understand loops."   
**Better Reflection:** "I don't undersand how the while loop exits."   
**Best Reflection:** "I struggle writing the proper exit conditions on a while loop." It's actionable: You can practice this, google it, ask Chat GPT to explain it, etc. 

**Poor Reflection** "I learned loops."   
**Better Reflection** "I learned how to write while loops and their difference from for loops."   
**Best Reflection** "I learned when to use while vs for loops. While loops are for sentiel-controlled values (waiting for a condition to occur), vs for loops are for iterating over collections of fixed values."

In this assignment, I learned how to build an ETL pipeline using Python and pandas to process parking violation data, focusing on aggregating and filtering based on specific conditions such as locations with total amounts over $1000. I also integrated this ETL process into a Streamlit app for an interactive user experience. The most challenging part was ensuring that function names matched the expected imports in the test files, which led to an ImportError. This experience highlighted the importance of maintaining consistency between code and tests, as well as the need to structure the code in a way that facilitates testing. One of my main struggles was understanding how to execute Streamlit scripts correctly, particularly the role of the if __name__ == "__main__": block, which I initially misunderstood in terms of how it interacts with Streamlit’s execution model. I also encountered issues with the way the functions were written and called, leading to confusion around variable scopes and data flows, especially when integrating the pandas data transformations into the Streamlit app. Additionally, I found it challenging to balance the data processing and user interface aspects of the project, making sure the app both performs well and remains user-friendly. Moving forward, I plan to deepen my understanding of Streamlit’s execution flow, practice refactoring code for better modularity, and improve my ability to structure ETL pipelines to make them easier to test and debug.
